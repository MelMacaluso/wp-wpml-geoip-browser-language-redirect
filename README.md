GeoIP Redirector for WPML
=======================================


This is a WordPress plugin that changes the browser language redirect in WPML from simple browser language detection to 
using a GeoIP database (MaxMind) to pinpoint user location more exactly.

## Usage

* Install this as a plugin
* Make sure WPML is enabled and that you have enabled the "Browser language redirect" in the WordPress admin, under WPML > Languages > Browser language redirect > Redirect visitors based on browser language only if translations exist (Enable this option)
* Set up your language mappings in the plugin UI
